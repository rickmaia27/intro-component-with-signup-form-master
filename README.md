## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Bootstrap
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Media Queries for mobile version
- javaScript
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS and JS framework

### What I learned

In this project, I was able to put into practice most of the things I've learned recently, mainly bootstrap, which I'm currently studying.

Where I had the most difficulty was identifying whether an email is valid using javascript and adapting the mobile version, I had already studied Media Queries but had not yet practiced.

This challenge was very valuable for me to practice what I have been learning.

### Continued development

I will continue to run frontend mentor challenges, always advancing in project difficulty.

### Useful resources

- [validate email](https://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/1386/express%c3%a3o-regular-para-valida%c3%a7%c3%a3o-de-e-mail) - it helped me to complete the email validation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
